# JSON Database Design Notes

## Core Concept
A fast-typed database using JSON for all components (META, definitions, records, etc.)

## Performance Optimization
- Using chunks for better performance and concurrency
- Each chunk is a separate JSON file
- Only load needed chunks into memory
- Better parallel processing capabilities
- Reduced lock contention

## Database Access Approaches Considered

### 1. Pure Object-Oriented API
```python
db.collection("users").find({"age": {"$gt": 25}})
```
**Pros:**
- Clean and intuitive
- Natural Python syntax
- Easy to maintain and extend

**Cons:**
- Less familiar to SQL developers
- Complex queries can become verbose
- Steeper learning curve for SQL experts

### 2. SQL-like Query Language
```python
db.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 25")
```
**Pros:**
- Familiar to SQL developers
- Good for ad-hoc queries
- Better for data analysts

**Cons:**
- No type safety
- String-based queries prone to errors
- Limited IDE support

### 3. SQLModel-style API (Recommended)
```python
select(User).where(User.age > 25)
```
**Pros:**
- Combines best of both worlds
- Full type safety and IDE support
- Familiar SQL-like syntax in Python
- Schema validation built-in
- Modern Python features (type hints, dataclasses)
- Better error catching at compile time
- Clear model definitions
- Easy to maintain and extend

**Example Model Definition:**
```python
@dataclass
class User:
    id: Optional[int] = None
    name: str
    email: str
    age: int
    created_at: datetime = datetime.now()
```

## Features to Implement
1. Core model system with type validation
2. Query builder supporting complex operations
3. Chunk management system
4. CRUD operations
5. Transaction support
6. Relationships between models
7. Schema validation
8. Indexing for better performance

## Technical Considerations
1. Chunk size optimization
2. Memory management
3. Concurrent access
4. Data integrity
5. Backup and restore operations
6. Version control friendly
7. Error handling and validation

## Migration Strategy
### Zero to Production Pipeline
The database is designed as a zero-configuration, ready-to-run solution with a clear migration path to production-grade databases:

1. **Development Phase**
   - Start with JSON database
   - No configuration needed
   - Instant setup
   - Perfect for prototyping
   - Same API as SQLModel/SQLAlchemy

2. **Migration to Production**
   - Same models work with SQLModel/SQLAlchemy
   - No code changes in business logic
   - Just change the database engine
   - Automated data migration tools
   - Zero downtime migration possible

### Compatible Design Patterns
- Models inherit from shared base class
- SQLModel-compatible type annotations
- Same relationship definitions
- Identical query syntax
- Common migration interfaces

Example Migration Path:
```python
# Development (JSON DB)
from json-orm import Model, select

class User(Model):
    id: Optional[int] = None
    name: str
    email: str

# Production (SQLModel)
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, select

class User(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: Optional[int] = None
    name: str
    email: str

# Business logic remains exactly the same:
users = select(User).where(User.name == "John")
```

## Benefits
1. Start projects instantly without database setup
2. Same API in development and production
3. Smooth transition to production databases
4. No vendor lock-in
5. Easy testing and prototyping
6. Production-ready code from day one

## Next Steps
1. Implement core model system
2. Build query builder
3. Integrate chunk management
4. Add CRUD operations
5. Implement transaction support
