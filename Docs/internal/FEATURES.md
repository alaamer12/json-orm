- **Boolean**: BOOLEAN
- **Arrays**: ARRAY[type]
- **JSON**: JSON, JSONB
- **Others**: UUID, ENUM

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)
```sql
-- Basic Operations
SELECT
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE

-- Joins

LEFT JOIN
RIGHT JOIN
FULL OUTER JOIN

-- Aggregations
COUNT
SUM
AVG
MIN
MAX
GROUP BY
HAVING

-- Conditions
WHERE
AND
OR
IN
NOT IN
BETWEEN
LIKE
IS NULL
IS NOT NULL

-- Ordering
ORDER BY
LIMIT
OFFSET
```

### Constraints
- PRIMARY KEY
- FOREIGN KEY
- UNIQUE
- NOT NULL
- CHECK (basic conditions)
- DEFAULT values

### Relationships
- One-to-One
- One-to-Many
- Many-to-Many (through intermediate tables)

### Transactions
- BEGIN
- COMMIT
- ROLLBACK
- Basic ACID properties for development

### Functions
```sql
-- String Functions
CONCAT
UPPER
LOWER
TRIM
SUBSTRING

-- Date Functions
NOW()
DATE_TRUNC
EXTRACT

-- Numeric Functions

## Migration Path

When you need these production features:
1. Export your data using our migration tools
2. Import into PostgreSQL/MySQL
3. Add production-specific features
4. Deploy to production

## Performance Considerations

Our JSON database is optimized for:
- Quick setup and development
- Small to medium datasets
- Rapid prototyping
- Local development
- Testing and validation

Not suitable for:
- High-concurrency workloads
- Very large datasets (>100GB)
- Mission-critical production use
- High-throughput applications

## Best Practices

1. Use for development and prototyping
2. Keep datasets reasonably sized
3. Regular backups of your JSON files
4. Plan migration to production database early
5. Test migration process periodically

## Future Considerations

Features we might add:
- Basic full-text search
- Simple caching mechanisms
- Basic query optimization
- Memory-efficient cursors
- Basic replication for development
